Math Game

A fune little Console based Math Game.

This implements some key learning points for me including:
1) Enums
2) Parsing Enums
3) Randomly selecting an Enum
4) Use of Switch Case
5) Methods
6) Classes
7) DRY principle (far from perfect but a significant improvement)
8) Refactoring to remove the ability to divided by 0 a
9) Refactoring to always present the large number first in a division
